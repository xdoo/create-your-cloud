We're running a little webapp, that creates an out of the box Spring cloud infrastructure for free. You can check it out on [http://www.create-your-cloud.com](http://www.create-your-cloud.com). We decided to store the code of this application in a private repository. We would like to ask you for your help to improve the software. If you want an awesome feature or you found a bug - please feel free to open an issue here.
